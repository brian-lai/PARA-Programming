# Archived Directories

**These directories are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.**

## Why Archived?

PARA-Programming now uses a unified `AGENTS.md` approach:
- Single methodology file works across all AI coding tools
- Tool-specific setup guides moved to `tool-setup/`
- Templates consolidated in `examples/`

## What Replaced What

| Archived Directory | Replaced By |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `claude/` | `tool-setup/claude-code.md` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `cursor/` | `tool-setup/cursor.md` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `copilot/` | `tool-setup/copilot.md` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `codex/` | `tool-setup/codex.md` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `gemini/` | `tool-setup/community/others.md` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `other-ai-assistants/` | `tool-setup/community/` + `AGENTS.md` |
| `*/templates/` | `examples/` |
